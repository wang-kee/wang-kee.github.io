I am a PhD student at at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne), under the supervision of Prof. Pascal Frossard. My research interests cover improving machine learning techniques in terms of  reliability, robustness and data efficiency.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my MSc in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Data Science and Systems from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and my BSc in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). 

I was also an intern in Oracle Labs in 2022 and Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019.
