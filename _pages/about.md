I am a PhD student at at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne), under the supervision of Prof. [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/%20people-current/frossard/). My research interests cover improving machine learning techniques in terms of  efficiency, reliability and robustness.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my MSc in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Data Science and Systems from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), and my BSc in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). 

I was also an intern in [Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/labs/labs/intro) in 2022 and [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in 2019.

I am from [Chengdu, Sichuan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chengdu,+Sichuan,+China/@26.794477,101.8413637,4.53z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x36efc52300447721:0xb98652ce2e240e02!8m2!3d30.5722599!4d104.0665099!16zL20vMDE2djQ2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Southwest China (where the pandas are from). In my free time, I like football, spicy food, running by Lake Geneva and skiing.
